A Toolchain is a CLI tool that has many functionalities and which is written in Cli DSL.
We call it like that because often we aggregate different CLI tools under a single toolchain 

Below we have a commented simple snippet of a toolchain writing "Hello" when called:
<Example/>

After [installing](/docs/getting-started/your-first-toolchain) the script, CLiMAT will 
create a binary called "my-toolchain" that we can invoke from the console
```bash title="Console"
$ my-toolchain
Hello
```
