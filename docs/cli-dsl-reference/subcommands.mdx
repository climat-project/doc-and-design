import Example from '../examples/cli-dsl-reference/subcommands/toolchain.cli.mdx'

In a Toolchain, you can have as many nested subcommands as you want.
Let's take the example from [earlier](/docs/cli-dsl-reference/toolchain) and add a subcommand to it:

After reinstalling the script, we can do the following:
```sh title="Console"
$ my-toolchain
Hello
$ my-toolchain child-toolchain
Child
```
