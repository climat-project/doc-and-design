In a Toolchain, you can have as many nested subcommands as you want.
Let's take the example from [earlier](/docs/cli-dsl-reference/toolchain) and add a subcommand to it:

<Toolchain/>

After reinstalling the script, we can do the following:
```sh title="Console"
$ my-toolchain
Hello
$ my-toolchain child-toolchain
Child
```

# Aliases

Sometimes you want one than more name for your subcommand. For example, the user may want 
to execute install with a shorthand (like `npm` supports `i` for install, eg `npm i climat`)

To achieve that, you can use the sub modifiers `@aliases` and `@alias`:

<Aliases/>

After reinstalling the script, we can do the following:

```sh title=Console
$ my-toolchain child-toolchain
Child
$ my-toolchain child
Child
$ my-toolchain ct
Child
$ my-toolchain c
Child
```
