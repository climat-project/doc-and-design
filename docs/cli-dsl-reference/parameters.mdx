# Parameters

Parameters are defined with a function header like syntax. 
Let's take a look at the "Hello World" example from [here](/docs/getting-started/your-first-toolchain.mdx).

<YourFirstToolchain/>

As you can see, our root toolchain supports a parameter, `location` that you can
then reference in your action templates and even constants.

We also defined a shorthand, `l` for our parameter.

Declare more than one parameter by separating them with a comma (`,`)

# Types

Currently, 2 types are supported:
* `arg` - a normal string value
* `flag` - a boolean value that is set to true if passed and set to false if omitted

# Scope

The params that you define for a toolchain can be referenced in any
descendant toolchain.

<Scope/>

```sh title=Console
$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca
Hello World from Cluj-Napoca

$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca child
Hello Child from Cluj-Napoca
```

# Optionals

Optional parameters will not be mandatory when the toolchain is run. 

If a value is not passed for an optional, it will default to: 
* empty string in case of an `arg`
* false in case of a `flag`

They are marked with the question mark (`?`) character at the end of their name:

<Optionals/>

```sh title=Console
$ hello-world 
Hello World from
```

# Defaults

Defaults are only supported for optional params.

<Defaults/>

```sh title=Console
$ hello-world 
Hello World from the other side

$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca
Hello World from Cluj-Napoca
```

# Overriding defaults

Sometimes, when you call a child toolchain, you could need
other defaults than what is defined in the parent toolchain.
But you also can't modify the original default value, because they
make sense for the parent, but not for the child.

Thats when you should override the defaults:

<OverridingDefaults/>

```sh title=Console
$ hello-world
Hello World from the other side

$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca
Hello World from Cluj-Napoca

$ hello-world child
Hello Child from this side

$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca child
Hello Child from Cluj-Napoca
```
