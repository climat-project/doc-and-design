# Introduction

CLiMAT, or **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface **Ma**cro **T**ree is a tool that streamlines working with command line interface tools. It can be used by both programmers and system administrators alike.

The core concept revolves around using a declarative approach to implement intuitive CLI interfaces.

Whether you want to create a new CLI tool, or you want a new CLI interface to an existing tool, CLiMAT can help you with that.

### Example
Here is a brief example of what CLiMAT can do:

```clidsl title="sgit.cli"
sgit {
    children [
        acp(amend a?: flag) {
            action "git add . && git commit $(amend:--amend) && git push $(amend:--force)"
        },
        cf(branch: arg, force f: flag) {
            action "git checkout feature/$(branch) $(force:--force)"
        }
    ]
}
```

This simple script will create a toolchain (a CLI tool that has many capabilities) named `sgit` with 2 subcommands:
 * `acp` which will execute `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`. Takes an optional parameter `amend` which will be passed on to the `git commit` as an `--amend` flag, and to the `git push` as the `--force` flag.
 * `cf` which will execute `git checkout`, but the passed-in branch is always prefixed with `feature/`.

The generated tool can be used like this
* `sgit acp`
* `sgit acp --amend`
* `sgit acp -a`
* `sgit cf myFeature`


This is it. Now you have a `git` macro that you can customize and tailor to your needs.

:::info
CLiMAT uses a special DSL ([Domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)) for its scripts that has many more capabilities than what is showcased in the above example.
