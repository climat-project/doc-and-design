# Your first toolchain

Let's write a "hello world" toolchain.
Start with creating a file named `helloWorld.cli`

```clidsl title=helloWorld.cli
hello-world(location l: arg) {
    action "echo Hello World from $(location)"
}
```

Install this via
```bash
climat install helloWorld.cli
```
:::caution
On Linux or other \*NIX systems, you might need to run the installation command from above as super user (eg. sudo npm i -g climat)
:::

Your first toolchain is ready to use:

```bash title=Console
$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca
Hello World from Cluj-Napoca
```

Now, the sky is the only limit!
