# Your first toolchain

Let's write a "hello world" toolchain.
Start with creating a file named `hello-world.cli`
<Example/>

Install this via
<Install/>

:::caution
On Linux or other \*NIX systems, you might need to run the installation command from above as super user (eg. `sudo climat install helloWorld.cli`)

On Windows systems, it might be necessary to add certain directory to system PATH.
Follow the installation warnings for more information
:::

Your first toolchain is ready to use:

```bash title=Console
$ hello-world Cluj-Napoca
Hello World from Cluj-Napoca
```

Now, the sky is the only limit!
